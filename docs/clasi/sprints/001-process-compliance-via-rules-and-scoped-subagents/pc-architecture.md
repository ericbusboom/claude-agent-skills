# Architecture 001: Process Compliance via Rules and Scoped Subagents

This document extends the CLASI architecture with two new enforcement
layers: path-scoped rules that inject process reminders at the point
of file access, and directory-scoped subagent dispatch that restricts
what each subagent can modify.

## The Compliance Problem

CLASI has three existing enforcement mechanisms:

1. **Instructional** — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, skill definitions telling
   agents what to do. Loads at session start, fades from context.
2. **Mechanical (state machine)** — SQLite phase transitions, review
   gates, execution locks. Cannot be bypassed — tools reject invalid
   operations.
3. **Hooks** — Session-start hook that echoes a reminder. Fires once,
   agent can ignore.

12 documented reflections show that mechanism 1 fails consistently.
Mechanism 2 works perfectly but only covers sprint lifecycle transitions.
Mechanism 3 is too weak.

This sprint adds two new mechanisms:

4. **Path-scoped rules** — `.claude/rules/` files with `paths` frontmatter.
   Claude Code loads these on demand when the agent accesses files
   matching the path pattern. Short, targeted, re-injected on every
   file access.
5. **Directory-scoped subagents** — Subagents dispatched with an explicit
   working-directory constraint. Controller validates output stays in
   scope.

## Path-Scoped Rules

### How Claude Code loads rules

Rules live in `.claude/rules/*.md`. Each file has YAML frontmatter
with a `paths` field — a list of glob patterns. When the agent reads
or writes a file matching any pattern, Claude Code loads the rule into
context. Rules are:

- **On-demand** — not loaded at session start; loaded when a matching
  file is accessed
- **Re-injected** — loaded again if the agent accesses the path after
  context compaction
- **Additive** — multiple matching rules all load; they don't override
  each other

### Rule inventory

```
.claude/rules/
├── clasi-artifacts.md    # paths: docs/clasi/**
├── source-code.md        # paths: claude_agent_skills/**, tests/**
├── todo-dir.md           # paths: docs/clasi/todo/**
└── git-commits.md        # paths: **/*.py, **/*.md
```

### Rule: clasi-artifacts

```yaml
paths:
  - docs/clasi/**
```

Fires when: agent touches any planning artifact (sprints, tickets,
TODOs, architecture, overview).

Content: Verify active sprint or OOP. Use CLASI MCP tools, not manual
file operations.

### Rule: source-code

```yaml
paths:
  - claude_agent_skills/**
  - tests/**
```

Fires when: agent modifies source code or tests.

Content: Verify in-progress ticket or OOP. Follow execute-ticket skill.
Run tests after changes.

### Rule: todo-dir

```yaml
paths:
  - docs/clasi/todo/**
```

Fires when: agent works in the TODO directory. More specific than
clasi-artifacts — both fire, but this one adds the tool-routing rule.

Content: Use CLASI `todo` skill or `move_todo_to_done` MCP tool. Do
not use generic TodoWrite.

### Rule: git-commits

```yaml
paths:
  - "**/*.py"
  - "**/*.md"
```

Fires when: agent touches any Python or Markdown file (which is nearly
always when committing).

Content: Run tests before committing. Verify sprint branch and
execution lock if on a sprint. Reference ticket ID in commit message.

### Coverage matrix

| Failure Mode | Which rules fire |
|---|---|
| Process bypass (no sprint) | clasi-artifacts, source-code |
| Wrong tool (TodoWrite) | todo-dir |
| No tests before commit | git-commits, source-code |
| Decision-point consultation | source-code (links to execute-ticket) |
| Completion bias | git-commits (verify before commit) |

## Directory-Scoped Subagent Dispatch

### Current model

The `dispatch-subagent` skill defines a controller/worker pattern:
controller curates context, dispatches via the Agent tool, reviews
results. But the subagent has no directory restriction — it can modify
any file it can access.

### New model

The controller specifies a **scope directory** for each subagent. This
is the directory the subagent is allowed to modify. The constraint
operates at two levels, with a third reserved for future implementation:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Dispatch["Controller dispatches"]
        prompt["Subagent prompt includes:<br/>scope_directory constraint"]
    end

    subgraph Execute["Subagent executes"]
        work["Reads context files<br/>(any location)"]
        write["Writes to<br/>scoped directory"]
        rules2["Path-scoped rules<br/>reinforce the constraint"]
    end

    Dispatch --> Execute

    style Dispatch fill:#e8f4fd
    style Execute fill:#f0f8e8
```

### Scope enforcement levels

1. **Prompt-level** (active) — The subagent prompt says "You may only
   create or modify files under `<scope_directory>`." The subagent can
   still read files anywhere (it needs to for context).

2. **Rule-level** (active) — If the subagent accesses files outside its
   scope, the path-scoped rules for those directories fire and remind
   it of the process requirements. This creates friction for out-of-scope
   writes.

3. **Validation-level** (future) — Post-hoc validation where the
   controller checks which files were modified. Deferred — the four-tier
   hierarchy with prompt + rules provides sufficient guidance, and
   OS-level file watching may handle this more reliably in the future.

### Subagent scope examples

| Task | Subagent type | Scope directory | Can read |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create TODOs from GitHub issues | todo-worker | `docs/clasi/todo/` | issue data, existing TODOs |
| Implement ticket code | python-expert | `claude_agent_skills/`, `tests/` | ticket, architecture, instructions |
| Write sprint planning docs | planner | `docs/clasi/sprints/NNN-slug/` | overview, previous architecture, TODOs |
| Update documentation | doc-writer | `docs/`, `README.md` | source code, existing docs |
| Code review | reviewer | (read-only, no writes) | changed files, ticket, standards |

### Dispatch-subagent skill changes

The skill gains:
- `scope_directory` parameter in the dispatch prompt template
- Context logging (see below) — every dispatch is recorded

### Subagent-protocol instruction changes

The instruction gains a new section: **Directory Scope**
- When dispatching, always specify the scope directory
- Subagents may read files from any location (needed for context)
- Subagents may only write/create/modify files within their scope
- If the task requires writing outside the scope, the subagent should
  return a request to the controller asking for expanded scope

## Subagent Hierarchy

The agent model has four tiers. Each tier delegates downward and
validates upward. No tier reaches past its immediate children.

```

### Context Logging

Every dispatch records what context was sent to the subagent. This
creates an audit trail for debugging why a subagent made a specific
decision.

**What is logged per dispatch:**
- Timestamp
- Dispatching agent (parent) and receiving agent (child)
- Scope directory
- List of files included in context (paths only, not content)
- Prompt summary (first 200 chars)
- Result summary (success/failure, files modified)

**Log directory structure:**

```
docs/clasi/log/
├── sprints/
│   ├── 001-my-sprint/
│   │   ├── sprint-planner.md      # planning dispatches
│   │   ├── ticket-001.md          # ticket-level dispatches
│   │   ├── ticket-002.md
│   │   └── ticket-003.md
│   └── 002-next-sprint/
│       └── ...
└── adhoc/
    ├── 001.md                     # first ad-hoc change
    ├── 002.md                     # second ad-hoc change
    └── ...                        # monotonic counter
```

**Routing rules:**
- **Sprint dispatches** (sprint-planner, architect, technical-lead):
  `docs/clasi/log/sprints/<sprint-name>/sprint-planner.md`
- **Ticket dispatches** (code-monkey, code-reviewer):
  `docs/clasi/log/sprints/<sprint-name>/ticket-NNN.md`
- **Ad-hoc dispatches** (ad-hoc-executor and its children):
  `docs/clasi/log/adhoc/<N>.md` where N is a monotonically
  incrementing counter (next unused integer in the directory)

**Log format** (appended per dispatch):

```markdown
## Dispatch: <parent> → <child>
- **Time**: 2026-03-19T14:30:00
- **Scope**: docs/clasi/todo/
- **Context files**: overview.md, todo/existing-idea.md, ...
- **Prompt**: "Import GitHub issues as TODOs. Only modify files..."
- **Result**: success — created 3 files
```

### Mapping to Existing Agents

| New hierarchy role | Current agent file | Status |
|---|---|---|
| main-controller | `project-manager.md` | Refactor to pure dispatcher |
| requirements-narrator | `requirements-analyst.md` + `product-manager.md` | Merge or keep both |
| todo-worker | (new) | New agent definition |
| sprint-planner | (new) | Extracted from project-manager |
| sprint-executor | (new) | Extracted from project-manager. Validates ticket frontmatter, updates sprint frontmatter. |
| ad-hoc-executor | (new) | Formalize OOP pattern |
| sprint-reviewer | (new, or extract from close-sprint) | Post-sprint validation |
| architect | `architect.md` | Unchanged |
| architecture-reviewer | `architecture-reviewer.md` | Unchanged |
| technical-lead | `technical-lead.md` | Unchanged |
| code-monkey | `python-expert.md` | Renamed. Absorbs ticket-implementer + documentation-expert. Language-agnostic — gets language-specific instructions per project. |
| code-reviewer | `code-reviewer.md` | Unchanged |

**Removed agents:**
- `python-expert.md` — replaced by code-monkey (no Python-specific behavior)
- `documentation-expert.md` — absorbed into code-monkey (docs are part of ticket implementation)

## Init Command Changes

`init_command.py` gains a `_create_rules()` function that:

1. Creates `.claude/rules/` directory
2. Writes each rule file (4 files)
3. Is idempotent: compares content before writing, skips unchanged files
4. Preserves any custom rules the developer has added

The rules content is bundled with the CLASI package (in a new
`init/rules/` directory or as string constants in `init_command.py`).

## Open Questions

None.

## Sprint Changes

Changes planned for sprint 001:

### New Components

**Path-scoped rules** (`.claude/rules/`) — Four rule files installed by
`clasi init`. Not Python code — static markdown with YAML frontmatter.

### Changed Components

**Init Command (`init_command.py`)** — New `_create_rules()` function
to install rule files during init. Follows the same idempotent pattern
as `_write_se_skill` and `_update_hooks_config`.

**Skill: `dispatch-subagent`** — Updated with `scope_directory` parameter
and context logging.

**Instruction: `subagent-protocol`** — New "Directory Scope" section
defining the read-anywhere/write-in-scope constraint.

**Log directory** (`docs/clasi/log/`) — New directory for dispatch
context logs. Sprint logs in `log/sprints/<name>/`, ad-hoc logs in
`log/adhoc/<N>.md`.

### Migration Concerns

Non-breaking. Rules are new files that don't affect existing behavior.
Running `clasi init` on existing projects adds the rules without
modifying other artifacts. The dispatch skill changes are additive —
subagents dispatched without a scope directory work as before.
