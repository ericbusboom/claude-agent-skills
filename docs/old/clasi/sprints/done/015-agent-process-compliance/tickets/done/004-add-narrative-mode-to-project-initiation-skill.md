# Add narrative mode to project-initiation skill

## Description

Update the `project-initiation` skill to offer a narrative mode option early
in the interview.

**File**: `claude_agent_skills/skills/project-initiation.md`

Add a step where the agent presents options via AskUserQuestion:
- "Answer structured questions" (current behavior)
- "Start an open narrative"

If narrative mode is chosen:
1. Agent listens to free-form stakeholder input
2. Agent synthesizes the narrative into structured documents
3. Agent follows up with clarifying questions for any gaps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] project-initiation skill offers narrative mode option via AskUserQuestion
- [x] Narrative mode instructions tell agent to listen, synthesize, then clarify
- [x] Structured question path still works as before

## Testing

- **Existing tests to run**: `uv run pytest tests/`
- **New tests to write**: None (skill definition is documentation)
- **Verification command**: `uv run pytest`
