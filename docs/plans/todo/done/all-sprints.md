# All Sprints. 


Let's change the way that the project starts. The initial project start we are
still going to do our brief in our technical plan and scenarios, instead of use
cases. Let's write just one document at the start, it is going to be longer but
the initial creation of the project is going to have that one document. That one
document will live at the top of the plans and it is going to be focused on the
general overview things that are likely to be true regardless of how the sprints
evolve over time. So it's not going into great technical details. It is going to
lay out things like, you know, is this a Python program or a TypeScript program?
And what are the basic requirements? And what are the high-level scenarios that
we're going to have? Like we know that there's an administrator and that there's
a user and that they log in with Google, that sort of stuff. But it is not going
into deep technical details. Or instead the technical details are going to be
all sprints all the time. When you start discussing how the project is going to
be laid out, we're doing it by creating sprints. An outline of those sprints
might be in the top-level document, the first document you make. We're going to
talk about how we might sequence the process so we kinda know what our first
sprint is going to be. But, you know, that top-level document should be real
general. And then all of the details and all of the tickets are always inside a
sprint.
