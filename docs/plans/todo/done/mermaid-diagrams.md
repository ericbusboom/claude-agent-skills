# Mermaid diagrams

When we when we are creating briefs and technical plans, about when we're
creating technical plans you should be illustrating important things with
Mermaid documents. You don't need to do everything. Most of the flow diagrams,
the swim lane diagrams I find are kind of useless unless you're really doing
something that has to be sequencing between multiple things. But I do want to
have diagrams showing modularity and interaction between sub-systems. Those
diagrams when they're created should show the system as it will exist at the end
of the sprint. So you're showing, and you don't have to show individual classes
so much. If the system's small and the individual classes are important, then
let's do that. But for the most part, we're looking at subsystems and what's the
communication between the subsystems. If you are going to do class diagrams,
then just do them within the subsystem. I don't need to see huge class diagrams
that list all the classes, but we do want to see what's the layout and structure
of things within a subsystem.
