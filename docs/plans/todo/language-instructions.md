# Language Instructions. 

Create a set of instructions, these will be in a sub-directory of instructions that are per language. Or per environment. So we can have specific instructions for how to do TypeScript projects or how to do Python projects. These are going to have instructions files per language and there is going to be an MCP interface to listing them and reading them.
