# Coding Standards. 

Our coding standard instructions have a bunch of stuff that's Python relevant, or it's actually about this particular repo. The coding standards probably shouldn't exist. Coding standards should be part of language-specific instructions. 

And module structure also shouldn't be part of coding standards because that's actually specific to whatever environment you're implementing in. So there's different frameworks and things. And so I don't think we need to talk about module structure because it just varies with whatever you're doing.
