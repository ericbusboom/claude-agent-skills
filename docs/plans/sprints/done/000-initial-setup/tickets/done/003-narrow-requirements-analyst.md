# 003: Narrow Requirements-Analyst Scope

## Description

Update `agents/requirements-analyst.md` to remove the technical plan from
its responsibilities. The requirements-analyst should only produce the brief
and use cases. The architect agent handles the technical plan.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] requirements-analyst.md no longer lists technical plan as an output
- [x] Documentation Flow stops after use cases
- [x] Notes that the architect handles the technical plan
