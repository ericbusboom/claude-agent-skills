# 011: Create Git Workflow Instruction — Plan

## Approach

Create `instructions/git-workflow.md` following the same format as the
existing testing and system-engineering instructions. The instruction
defines how agents interact with git during ticket execution.

## Files to Create or Modify

- **Create**: `instructions/git-workflow.md`

## Testing Plan

This is a markdown instruction file, not code. Verification is by
inspection: read the file and confirm all acceptance criteria are met.

## Documentation Updates

None — this file is itself documentation.
