# Update SE Instructions for Sprint Workflow

Final integration ticket: update `instructions/system-engineering.md` to
incorporate the sprint concept, reference new agents and skills, and update
the directory layout.

## Description

This is the integration ticket that ties everything together. The SE
instructions need to describe the sprint workflow, reference the new agents
(code-reviewer, architecture-reviewer), reference the new skills
(plan-sprint, close-sprint), and show the updated directory layout.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agents section lists code-reviewer and architecture-reviewer
- [ ] Skills section lists plan-sprint and close-sprint
- [ ] Workflow section describes sprint lifecycle after initial setup
- [ ] Directory layout includes `docs/plans/sprints/` and `done/`
- [ ] Sprint is positioned as the default working mode
- [ ] Rules for AI Assistants reference sprint workflow
- [ ] All cross-references are consistent
