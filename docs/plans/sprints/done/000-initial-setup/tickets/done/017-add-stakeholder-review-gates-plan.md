# 017: Add Stakeholder Review Gates — Plan

## Approach

Add review gates to `instructions/system-engineering.md` after Phase 1a,
1b, and 2. Update `agents/project-manager.md` to include pause-for-approval
behavior. Define what approval means and how revisions work.

## Files to Modify

- `instructions/system-engineering.md` — Add review gate steps
- `agents/project-manager.md` — Add approval behavior

## Testing Plan

Verification by inspection.

## Documentation Updates

The modified files are themselves the documentation.
