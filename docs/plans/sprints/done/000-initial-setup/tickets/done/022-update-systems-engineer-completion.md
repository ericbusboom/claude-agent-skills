# 022: Update Systems-Engineer Completion Section

## Description

The "Completing Tickets" section in `agents/systems-engineer.md` is stale.
It's missing the git commit step, the Definition of Done reference, and
has a different order than the SE instructions. Update to match.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Completion steps match `instructions/system-engineering.md` "Completing a Ticket"
- [x] References the Definition of Done
- [x] Includes git commit step
