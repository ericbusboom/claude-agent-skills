# Sprint 000: Initial Setup

Retroactive sprint encompassing all work done before the sprint-directory
model was adopted. Includes the initial repository setup, agent and skill
definitions, SE process instructions, and the ticket system itself.

## Goals

- Establish the `claude-agent-skills` package
- Create agent definitions (project-manager, requirements-analyst, architect,
  systems-engineer, python-expert, documentation-expert, code-reviewer,
  architecture-reviewer)
- Create skill definitions (elicit-requirements, create-technical-plan,
  create-tickets, execute-ticket, project-status, python-code-review,
  generate-documentation, plan-sprint, close-sprint)
- Create instruction files (system-engineering, git-workflow, coding-standards,
  testing)
- Establish the SE process and orchestration model

## Scope

All 34 original tickets (001-034) covering repository setup, agent creation,
skill creation, instruction creation, and SE process refinement.
