# 020: Add Decision Heuristics to Project-Manager Agent

## Description

Update `agents/project-manager.md` with decision-making guidance: how to
prioritize parallel-ready tickets, what to do when blocked, how to handle
scope creep, and when to escalate to the human.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] project-manager agent includes ticket prioritization heuristics
- [ ] Includes blocker handling guidance
- [ ] Includes scope creep handling (new ticket vs. absorb)
- [ ] Includes escalation criteria (when to ask the human)
