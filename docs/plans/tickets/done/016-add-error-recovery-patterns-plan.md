# 016: Add Error Recovery Patterns — Plan

## Approach

Add an "Error Recovery" section to `instructions/system-engineering.md`
after the "Completing a Ticket" subsection. Covers the four main failure
modes: test failures, plan gaps, oversized tickets, and unresolvable blockers.

## Files to Modify

- `instructions/system-engineering.md`

## Testing Plan

Verification by inspection.

## Documentation Updates

The modified file is itself the documentation.
