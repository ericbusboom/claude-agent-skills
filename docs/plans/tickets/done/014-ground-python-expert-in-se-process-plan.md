# 014: Ground Python-Expert Agent in SE Process — Plan

## Approach

Rewrite `agents/python-expert.md` to replace the generic Python expert
description with one grounded in the SE process. The agent should know
about tickets, ticket plans, testing/coding instructions, and acceptance
criteria.

## Files to Modify

- `agents/python-expert.md`

## Testing Plan

Verification by inspection: confirm SE references and ticket awareness.

## Documentation Updates

None — the agent file is the deliverable.
