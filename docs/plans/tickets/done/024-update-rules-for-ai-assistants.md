# 024: Update Rules for AI Assistants Section

## Description

The "Rules for AI Assistants" section in `instructions/system-engineering.md`
doesn't reference the Definition of Done, git-workflow, or coding-standards
instructions. Update it to reflect the current process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] References the Definition of Done as the completion standard
- [x] References `instructions/git-workflow.md`
- [x] References `instructions/coding-standards.md`
- [x] Removes stale "no ticket is done without tests" (superseded by DoD)
