# 012: Create Coding Standards Instruction — Plan

## Approach

Create `instructions/coding-standards.md` following the same format as
existing instructions. Covers Python-focused conventions since that's the
current dev agent. Keep it practical — rules agents can follow, not an
exhaustive style guide.

## Files to Create or Modify

- **Create**: `instructions/coding-standards.md`

## Testing Plan

Markdown instruction file. Verification by inspection.

## Documentation Updates

None — this file is itself documentation.
