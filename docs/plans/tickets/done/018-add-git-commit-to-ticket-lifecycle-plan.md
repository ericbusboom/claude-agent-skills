# 018: Add Git Commit Step to Ticket Lifecycle — Plan

## Approach

Add a git commit step to both `skills/execute-ticket.md` and the
"Completing a Ticket" section of `instructions/system-engineering.md`.
The commit should happen after all work is verified and before moving
the ticket to done/.

## Files to Modify

- `skills/execute-ticket.md` — Add commit step before completion
- `instructions/system-engineering.md` — Add commit step to "Completing a Ticket"

## Testing Plan

Verification by inspection.

## Documentation Updates

The modified files are themselves the documentation.
