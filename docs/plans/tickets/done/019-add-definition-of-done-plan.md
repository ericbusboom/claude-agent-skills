# 019: Add Definition of Done — Plan

## Approach

Add a "Definition of Done" section to `instructions/system-engineering.md`
that consolidates all completion requirements into one checklist. Update
the "Completing a Ticket" section to reference the DoD. Update the
project-manager agent to verify the DoD.

## Files to Modify

- `instructions/system-engineering.md` — Add DoD section, update completion
- `agents/project-manager.md` — Reference DoD in verification

## Testing Plan

Verification by inspection.

## Documentation Updates

The modified files are themselves the documentation.
