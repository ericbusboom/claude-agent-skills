# 015: Add Code Review Gate to Ticket Lifecycle — Plan

## Approach

Add a code review step to `skills/execute-ticket.md` between testing and
documentation. Also update `instructions/system-engineering.md` Phase 3 to
reference the review step. Define what the review checks.

## Files to Modify

- `skills/execute-ticket.md` — Add review step after step 6 (run tests)
- `instructions/system-engineering.md` — Add review step to Phase 3

## Testing Plan

Verification by inspection: confirm review step exists in both files.

## Documentation Updates

The modified files are themselves the documentation.
