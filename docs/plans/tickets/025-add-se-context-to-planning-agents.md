# 025: Add SE Process Context to Planning Agents

## Description

The python-expert and documentation-expert have "SE Process Context"
sections listing artifact paths. The architect and requirements-analyst
don't. Add consistent SE context sections to both for discoverability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `agents/architect.md` has an SE Process Context section with artifact paths
- [ ] `agents/requirements-analyst.md` has an SE Process Context section with artifact paths
- [ ] Both reference `instructions/system-engineering.md`
