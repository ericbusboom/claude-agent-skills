# Scold Detection

When the stakeholder corrects your behavior, produces frustration signals,
or explicitly points out an error in your approach:

1. Acknowledge the correction immediately.
2. Run the **self-reflect** skill to produce a structured reflection
   document in `docs/plans/reflections/`.
3. Continue with the corrected approach.

## Detection Signals

Watch for these patterns in stakeholder messages:

- **Direct correction**: "no", "that's wrong", "you shouldn't have done that"
- **Process critique**: "why did you do X?", "that's not how it works",
  "there's a flaw in the process"
- **Frustration**: "I told you to...", "you keep doing...", "I already said..."
- **Explicit instruction**: "reflect on that", "analyze what went wrong"

## When NOT to Trigger

- Simple clarifications ("I meant X, not Y") — just correct and move on
- Feature requests or new instructions — these are forward-looking, not corrections
- Questions about your reasoning — answer the question, don't self-reflect
