"""Canonical rule body content for all five CLASI path-scoped rules.

This module is the single source of truth for rule content.  Both
``claude.py`` and ``codex.py`` import from it.  Neither platform
hardcodes rule strings of its own.

Boundary: data-only module.  No I/O, no side effects, no imports from
other CLASI modules.  Leaf node in the dependency graph.

MCP_REQUIRED_BODY = """\
This project uses the CLASI MCP server. Before doing ANY work:

1. Call `get_version()` to verify the MCP server is running.
2. If the call fails, STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the stakeholder:
   "The CLASI MCP server is not available. Check .mcp.json and
   restart the session."
3. Do NOT create sprint directories, tickets, TODOs, or planning
   artifacts manually. Do NOT improvise workarounds. All SE process
   operations require the MCP server.
"""

CLASI_ARTIFACTS_BODY = """\
You are modifying CLASI planning artifacts. Before making changes:

1. Confirm you have an active sprint (`list_sprints(status="active")`),
   or the stakeholder said "out of process" / "direct change".
2. If creating or modifying tickets, the sprint must be in `ticketing`
   or `executing` phase (`get_sprint_phase(sprint_id)`).
3. Use CLASI MCP tools for all artifact operations — do not create
   sprint/ticket/TODO files manually.

Direct edits to `docs/clasi/sprints/` are blocked for team-lead. Use MCP tools.
"""

SOURCE_CODE_BODY = """\
You are modifying source code or tests. Before writing code:

1. You must have a ticket in `in-progress` status, or the stakeholder
   said "out of process".
2. If you have a ticket, follow the execute-ticket skill — call
   `get_skill_definition("execute-ticket")` if unsure of the steps.
3. Run the project's test suite after changes.
"""

TODO_DIR_BODY = """\
Use the CLASI `todo` skill or `move_todo_to_done` MCP tool for TODO
operations. Do not use the generic TodoWrite tool for CLASI TODOs.
"""

GIT_COMMITS_BODY = """\
Before committing, verify:
1. All tests pass (run the project's test suite).
2. If on a sprint branch, the sprint has an execution lock.
3. Commit message references the ticket ID if working on a ticket.

After committing substantive changes, run `clasi version bump` to
advance the version, then commit that change (`chore: bump version`).
Tools are installed editable, so the version is how sessions tell
which code is live — bump per commit, not just at sprint close.
Skip the manual bump right before `close_sprint` (it bumps + tags).

See `instructions/git-workflow` for full rules.
