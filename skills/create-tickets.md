# Create Tickets Skill

This skill breaks a technical plan into actionable implementation tickets
using the systems-engineer agent.

## Agent Used

**systems-engineer**

## Inputs

- `docs/plans/technical-plan.md` (must exist)
- `docs/plans/usecases.md` (must exist)

## Process

1. **Read artifacts**: Read the technical plan and use cases.
2. **Identify work units**: Break the technical plan into coherent
   implementation units. Each unit should be completable in one focused
   session.
3. **Order by dependency**: Number tickets so that foundation work comes
   before features that depend on it. Record dependencies in each ticket's
   `depends-on` field.
4. **Create ticket files**: Write each ticket to the sprint's
   `tickets/NNN-slug.md` with YAML frontmatter (id, title, status,
   use-cases, depends-on) and body (description, acceptance criteria,
   implementation notes). Ticket numbering is per-sprint (starts at 001).
5. **Verify coverage**: Every use case must be covered by at least one
   ticket. Every ticket must trace to at least one use case.
6. **Verify sequencing**: No circular dependencies. Foundation before
   features.

## Output

Numbered ticket files in the sprint's `tickets/` directory, ready for
implementation.
