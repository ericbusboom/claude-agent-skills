# TODO Skill

This skill captures an idea or task as a TODO file in the project's
TODO directory.

## Process

1. Take the user's input (everything after `/todo`).
2. Create a markdown file in `docs/plans/todo/` with:
   - A `# ` heading summarizing the idea
   - A description section expanding on the idea
3. Filename: slugified version of the heading (e.g., `my-idea.md`).
4. If `docs/plans/todo/` doesn't exist, create it.

## Output

Confirm the file was created and show its path.
