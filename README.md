# CLASI — Claude Agent Skills Instructions

An MCP server that gives Claude Code (and GitHub Copilot) a structured
software engineering process. It provides agents, skills, and instructions
that guide an AI assistant through the full lifecycle of a project: from
requirements through architecture, sprint planning, implementation, and
release.

## Installation

Install with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) directly from GitHub:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/ericbusboom/claude-agent-skills.git
```

This puts the `clasi` command on your PATH. To update later:

```bash
pipx upgrade claude-agent-skills
```

For development, clone and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericbusboom/claude-agent-skills.git
cd claude-agent-skills
pipx install -e .
```

## Initializing a Project

In any git repository, run:

```bash
clasi init
```

This creates:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/rules/*.md` | Always-on instructions loaded by Claude Code |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Slash-command stubs (`/next`, `/todo`, `/status`, `/project-initiation`) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | MCP permission allowlist |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server configuration pointing to `clasi mcp` |
| `.github/copilot/instructions/` | Mirror of the SE process rule for GitHub Copilot |

After init, open the project in Claude Code or VS Code with Copilot.
The MCP server starts automatically when the AI connects.

## Typical Workflow

A project moves through four stages. You can drive the whole process with
the `/next` slash command, which inspects the current state and runs
whatever comes next.

### 1. Project Initiation

Start a new project by telling the agent what you want to build.
Use `/project-initiation` or just `/next` on an empty repo.

The agent interviews you, asks clarifying questions, and produces
`docs/clasi/overview.md` — a one-page summary of the problem, scope,
constraints, and high-level use cases.

### 2. Sprint Planning

When the overview is ready, `/next` creates a sprint. Each sprint gets:

- **Sprint document** — goals, scope, branch name
- **Use cases** — detailed scenarios for this sprint
- **Architecture document** — components, design decisions, sprint changes

The plan goes through an architecture review gate and a stakeholder
approval gate before any code is written.

### 3. Ticket Execution

After approval, the sprint's architecture document is broken into numbered
tickets with dependency ordering. The agent executes them one by one:
plan, implement, test, commit.

You can watch it work or step away. Use `/status` at any time to see
where things stand.

### 4. Sprint Close

When all tickets are done, the agent merges the sprint branch to main,
tags a version, and archives the sprint to `docs/clasi/sprints/done/`.
Then `/next` picks up the next sprint or reports that the project is
complete.

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/next` | Determine the next process step and execute it |
| `/status` | Report current project state, progress, and next actions |
| `/todo <description>` | Capture an idea as a TODO file in `docs/clasi/todo/` |
| `/project-initiation` | Start a new project with a guided interview |

## How It Works

CLASI is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. When Claude Code or
Copilot connects, the server exposes tools that the AI calls to read
process definitions and manage artifacts:

- **Agents** — role definitions (architect, technical lead, code reviewer, etc.)
  that shape the AI's behavior for specific tasks
- **Skills** — step-by-step workflows (plan a sprint, execute a ticket, close
  a sprint) that the AI follows
- **Instructions** — coding standards, git workflow rules, and testing
  guidelines loaded on demand
- **Artifact tools** — create sprints, create tickets, track status, manage
  the `docs/clasi/` directory structure

The AI reads these definitions at runtime via MCP tool calls. The slash
command stubs installed by `clasi init` are thin wrappers that tell the
AI to fetch the real instructions from the server.
